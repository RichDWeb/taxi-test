                                Burry Port Local Cabs works with a small network of assured Taxi operators, and as 
                                such we may sometimes share your booking requests with our recognised partners, 
                                when we do they may contact you with a quote, and later invoice you if required.  
                                Once you receive their invoice it is only then that you pay.
